    "### Overview\n",
    "A one-time pad refers to a cryptographic system where a secret key is generated from a fully, or uniformly, random set of values and used only once to both encrypt and decrypt a single message. If the following conditions are met, then use of a one-time pad enables “perfect secrecy”, which indicates that given the ciphertext of the message, an adversary gains no additional information about the underlying plaintext message, even if the adversary has theoretically infinite computing power:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The secret key is only used once\n",
    "- The values used to generate the key must be truly random\n",
    "- The secret key is securely shared between the sending and receiving parties\n",
    "- The secret key must be at least as long as the plaintext being encrypted"

    "### Theoretical Foundation\n",
    "This last requirement is based on a theorem by Claude Shannon, which is stated formally as:\n",
    "$$\\text{Any cipher achieving perfect secrecy requires that } |K| \\geq |M|,$$\n",
    "where $ K $ is the key space and $ M $ is the plaintext message space. Like other encryption systems, one-time pads also adhere to Kerckhoffs's Principle, which states: “[The method of encryption] must not be required to be secret, and it must be able to fall into the enemy’s hands without causing inconvenience.” This principle implies that even if an adversary has knowledge of the encryption technique, they will be unable to decrypt without the secret key."

    "#### Explanation\n",
    "One-time pad encryption means that Alice starts with a plaintext message typed by the user. The message is then converted into digital form, typically in bytes. Next, Alice’s program generates a random key that’s exactly as long as the message. This random key is needed for security, because if the key is truly unpredictable, it prevents anyone from guessing the original text. The encryption step uses the XOR (exclusive OR) operation, which compares each bit of the plaintext with the corresponding bit of the key. If the bits are different, it writes a 1; if they are the same, it writes a 0. This produces the ciphertext, which is unreadable unless you have the key. Finally, Alice saves the ciphertext and key in a shared or secure location. If the key stays secret and is never reused, the one-time pad offers nearly perfect security. This approach makes sure that without the key, decryption is impossible."

    "#### Explanation\n",
    "While Alice is responsible for encrypting a message with the one-time pad, Bob’s job is to do the reverse process: decryption. He starts by receiving the ciphertext and the key, which are stored here in separate files. He reads them in, converting from hexadecimal format back into bytes, making sure he works with the exact same data used by Alice. Then, Bob performs the XOR operation again, this time using the ciphertext and the key as inputs. Because XOR is its own inverse, applying it once more recovers the original plaintext. If Alice’s key and ciphertext were transmitted correctly, Bob’s decrypted output will match the exact message Alice sent. After that, Bob simply converts the plaintext bytes back into letters, displaying them on his screen. This part of the process shows the importance to keep the key safe, since anyone who has it can completely read the secret messages."

    "### Analysis of Vulnerabilities\n",
    "The many-time pad implementation is a direct derivative of the one-time pad. Despite being nearly the same, it creates a major weakness. The only meaningful difference needed was to generate a key suitably long enough for all messages. The plaintext messages are submitted and then a key long enough to encrypt the longest plaintext message is generated. The encryption step uses the XOR operation between the key and the message, in turn creating the ciphertext. The same key is used for all messages; if a message is shorter than the key, then the key and the plaintext apply XOR operation for the length of the plaintext message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious result is that plaintext characters (and words) in the same position between messages are encrypted into the same ciphertext. Spaces are especially common and a strong weakness. For example, consider the messages:\n",
    "- “and i ran out of text already”\n",
    "- “and so on”\n",
    "- “and on”\n",
    "\n",
    "These result in ciphertext (in hex):\n",

    "- 529ffc8888482fe101\n",
    "- 529ffc889449\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to the understanding that the XOR of the key at any given position yields the same result. If we XOR those two ciphertexts together, it reveals areas of matching words and replicates the same pattern as the same two plaintexts would produce when an XOR is performed on them. When 10 ciphertexts are all analyzed the same way, many insights into the similarities (and differences) between the messages become apparent, and so guessing the contents becomes possible; thus the crib drag is born. Additionally, frequency analysis can help give guesses direction."
